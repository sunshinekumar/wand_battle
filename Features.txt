Looking Ahead:
Splash screens (Start, spellbook, and game over)
tracing too long of a spell backfires on you

To be tried:

each player has their own color (circles, wand, tutorial)
has a damage modifier, for example if you cast an unforgivable curse and are cursed
variables for damage of each spell
